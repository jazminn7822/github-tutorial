## Git vs. GitHub

#### What is Git?
Git is a version control system that runs in the command line. A version control system means that if you were working on a file and you decide to edit, delete, or move things, git will allow us to keep a picture or a snapshot of the code. This will help us see the changes we have made in the past and will allow us to get something back if we would like. The good thing about Git is that we can use it without having to use GitHub.
