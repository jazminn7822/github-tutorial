## Git vs. GitHub

#### _What is Git?_
Git is a version control system that runs in the command line. A version control system means that if you were working on a file and you decide to edit, delete, or move things, git will allow us to keep a picture or a snapshot of the code. This will help us see the changes we have made in the past and will allow us to get something back if we would like. The good thing about Git is that we can use it without having to use GitHub.
#### _What is GitHub?_
GitHub is a website that saves your code to the cloud. It is very useful when you would like to collaborate with others on a certain file. GitHub also gives you the ablility to interact with other repositories and visually track the past changes or commits they have done to the file. However, GitHub does require git.
